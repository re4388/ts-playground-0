// I then continue as before, replacing other callers and inlining the old function into the new one. I would also inline the variables I extracted to provide the clean separation for extracting the new function.
// Because this variation is entirely composed of refactorings, itâ€™s particularly handy when I have a refactoring tool with robust extract and inline operations.
