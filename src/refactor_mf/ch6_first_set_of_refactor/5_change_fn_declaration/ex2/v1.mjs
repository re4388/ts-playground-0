// I have a book class which has the ability to take a reservation for a customer.

// I need to support a priority queue for reservations. Thus, I need an extra parameter on addReservation to indicate whether the reservation should go in the usual queue or the high-priority queue.


class Book {
  addReservation(customer) {
    this.addReservationV1(customer);
  }

  // I begin by using Extract Function (106) on the body of addReservation to create the new function. Although it will eventually be called addReservation, the new and old functions canâ€™t coexist with the same name. So I use a temporary name that will be easy to search for later.
  addReservationV1(customer) {
    this._reservations.push(customer)
  }
}
