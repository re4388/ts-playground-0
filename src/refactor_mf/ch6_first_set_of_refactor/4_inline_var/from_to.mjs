/**
 * why
 *
 * inverse of: Extract Variable (119)
 *
 * Variables provide names for expressions within a function, and as such they are usually a Good Thing.
 *
 * But sometimes, the name doesnâ€™t really communicate more than the expression itself.
 * At other times, you may find that a variable gets in the way of refactoring the neighboring code.
 * In these cases, it can be useful to inline the variable.
